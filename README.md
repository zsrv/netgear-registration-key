# NETGEAR Registration Key Generator

This script generates registration keys for NETGEAR Smart Managed Pro switches.

Registration keys were initially required for full access to the local management UI of the switch,
but this was made optional in later firmware revisions. However, you still have to click through a
page encouraging you to register the switch each time you want to access the management UI:

NETGEAR intends for the user to create an account on the NETGEAR website and register the switch using
its serial number. The registration key will be available on the website once the switch is registered.

The registration key is unique to each device as it is generated using the device's serial number.

Once the registration key has been entered, future visits to the local management UI will take you
directly to the login page:
